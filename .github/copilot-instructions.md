# Copilot Instructions for ym2151-log-player

## Repository Overview

This repository is an experimental project (`実験用`) related to YM2151 sound chip log playback functionality. The YM2151 is a famous FM synthesis sound chip used in arcade games and synthesizers from the 1980s.

## Repository Structure

The repository currently has a minimal structure:
- `README.md` - Project documentation (bilingual)
- `LICENSE` - MIT License
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules for C/C++ projects

## Project Purpose

This is an experimental repository for developing tools or applications to play back YM2151 sound chip logs. The exact implementation details are still being developed.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Language and Communication
- This project supports both Japanese and English
- The repository name and structure use English, while some documentation contains Japanese text
- Code comments and documentation may be in Japanese or English

### Code Standards
- Follow the existing code style in the repository
- Maintain compatibility with the project's objectives
- Keep experimental code well-documented

### Building and Testing
- As this is an early-stage experimental project, build and test procedures will be defined as the project develops
- Check for any Makefile, CMakeLists.txt, or other build configuration files before making changes

### Development Workflow
1. Make minimal, focused changes
2. Test changes thoroughly before committing
3. Document any new features or experimental findings
4. Keep commits atomic and well-described

## Technical Principles

- **Simplicity**: Keep implementations straightforward and maintainable
- **Experimentation**: This is an experimental repository - innovative approaches are welcome
- **Documentation**: Document experimental features and findings clearly
- **Compatibility**: Consider cross-platform compatibility where applicable

## Best Practices for Working on This Repository

1. **Understand the Context**: The YM2151 is a specific sound chip, so changes should respect its technical specifications
2. **Incremental Development**: Build features incrementally given the experimental nature
3. **Test Audio Output**: Any audio-related changes should be tested with actual playback
4. **Respect the License**: All contributions must be compatible with the MIT License

## Notes for AI Assistants

- This is an early-stage experimental project
- Be mindful of the Japanese language context in documentation
- Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous
- Focus on creating clean, maintainable code suitable for an experimental project
- Consider the audio/sound chip domain when making suggestions
